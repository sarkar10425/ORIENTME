<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
<p>
Solving a rubik‚Äôs cube is now too mainstream they say. But what if you have 10,000 pictures of the rubicks cube and you are asked to stitch it all together? This is not a problem we need, this is a problem we deserve!
For input you will be given a large number of images, for about half of them, we have measured the orientation of the cube. But to be able to stitch all those images together, you have to figure out how to predict the orientation of the Rubik's Cube for the rest of the images.
